## CURRENT MIRROR WITH ACTIVE LOAD CIRCUITS 

### AIM 

To design and analyze the given current mirror circuit with the following specifications:

Voltage Gain (Av) > -10 V/V
Supply Voltage (Vdd) = 1.8V
Power Consumption (P) <= 1W
Design for 1:1 and 1:2 current ratios
with three cases for channel length (L):
L = 180 nm ; L = 500 nm ; L = 1 Î¼m
