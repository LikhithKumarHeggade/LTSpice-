## MOSFET DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS 
### AIM 
To design and analyze MOSFET differential amplifier for the following specification P <= 2.2mW, Vdd = 1.8V, Vicm = 0.95V, Vocm = 1.1V and Vp = 0.4V
To perform DC, AC, Transient and Frequency Response Analysis and extract parameters like Gain, quiescent point (Q point), maximum and minimum input and output 
voltage swing. 
### COMPONENTS NEEDED 
Identical PMOSET and NMOSFETs, Identical Resistors Rd, Resistor Rss and DC voltage sources 
### THEORY 
- MOS differential pair is the fourth fundamental amplifier topology.
- It is less sensitive to noise and interference compared to single transistor amplifier, it is well suited for DC coupled multistage designs.
- It rejects
